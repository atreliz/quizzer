Build a simple quizz with Angulajs

The score to a pass or fail is easy editable, same as the questions, wich make the app really reusable.

![Question Page](screenshots/welcome.png "Question Example")
![Result Page](screenshots/welcome.png "Result Fail")

you will find an example of the Json format to read the questions on the file quizz.json
